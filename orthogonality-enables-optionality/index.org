#+title: Orthogonality enables optionality

[[./..][..]]

Approach: compose each layer of your app so that its part are orthogonal. That
enables flexibility and optionality in the layer above. Above layers can move
around without the base layer needing changes.

In some applications, we might have these layers:

1. Infrastructure. Problems to be solved.
2. Product features.
3. User workflows.

* Notes :noexport:
orthogonal infrastructure + indirection -> orthogonal features

orthononal team skills -> optionality + speed -> success

orthogonality > SRP

I like orthogonality.
