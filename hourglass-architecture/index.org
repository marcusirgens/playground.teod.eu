#+title: Hourglass architecture

[[./..][..]]

Status: WIP.

Hourglass architecture, flexiblity, optionality and orthogonality are related!

By building /layered/ applications where each layer builds on a lowere level,
designed orthogonally, we gain power in each level.

Layers:

1. Infrastructure. Problems to be solved.
2. Product features.
3. User workflows.

* Ideas :noexport:
"multilayer" hourglass architecture?

pandoc - intermediate format

perhaps this is just the "depend on interface" thing?
